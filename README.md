# Min-Heap Console Application

## Introduction  
This Java console application demonstrates a Min-Heap data structure, where the smallest value is always at the root. It is commonly used in tasks like priority queues and scheduling.

## What the Application Can Do  
1. Insert values into the heap.  
2. Remove and display the smallest value.  
3. Show the current heap structure interactively.

## Why This Application Was Made  
The application helps users understand how heaps work by simulating insertion and removal operations. Itâ€™s a practical tool for learning fundamental data structures.

## How This Contributes  
- **For the User:** Simplifies learning heap operations.  
- **For the Community:** Provides a reusable example of heap-based solutions.
