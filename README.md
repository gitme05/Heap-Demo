# Min-Heap Console Application

## Introduction
This is a simple Java console application that implements a Min-Heap data structure. A Min-Heap is a binary tree where the parent node is smaller than its child nodes, making it useful for applications like priority queues.

## What the Application Can Do
- The application allows inserting values into the Min-Heap.
- It can remove and return the smallest value (the root of the heap).
- It demonstrates the heapify-up and heapify-down operations for maintaining the heap property.

## Why This Application Was Made
This application was created to demonstrate how heap data structures work, specifically focusing on the Min-Heap variant. Understanding how heaps maintain their structure after insertions and removals is crucial in fields like algorithm design, priority queues, and resource scheduling systems.

## How This Contributes

### For the User:
- It helps understand heap operations and their importance in algorithm efficiency.
- It showcases real-world use cases such as scheduling tasks or managing a priority queue.

### For the Community:
- This application could be used as a reference for understanding and implementing heap-based solutions in other systems or applications.
